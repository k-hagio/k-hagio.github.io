    diskdump: Optimize the boot time
    
    1.) The vmcore file maybe very big.
    
        For example, I have a vmcore file which is over 23G,
        and the panic kernel had 767.6G memory,
        its max_sect_len is 4468736.
    
        Current code costs too much time to do the following loop:
        ..............................................
            for (i = 1; i < max_sect_len + 1; i++) {
                    dd->valid_pages[i] = dd->valid_pages[i - 1];
                    for (j = 0; j < BITMAP_SECT_LEN; j++, pfn++)
                            if (page_is_dumpable(pfn))
                                    dd->valid_pages[i]++;
        ..............................................
    
        For my case, it costs about 56 seconds to finish the
        big loop.
    
        This patch moves the hweightXX macros to defs.h,
        and uses hweight64 to optimize the loop.
    
        For my vmcore, the loop only costs about one second now.
    
    2.) Tests result:
      # cat ./commands.txt
          quit

    Fix the failure of resolving ".rodata" on s390x
    
    The commit <cd8954023bd4> broke crash-utility on s390x and got the
    following error:
    
      crash: cannot resolve ".rodata"
    
    The reason is that all symbols containing a "." may be filtered out
    on s390x. To prevent the current failure, do not filter out the
    symbol ".rodata" on s390x.
    
    In addition, a simple way is to check whether the symbol ".rodata"
    exists before calculating the value of a symbol, just to be on the
    safe side.

    kernel: fix start-up time degradation caused by strings command
    
    verify_namelist() uses strings command and scans full part of vmlinux
    file to find linux_banner string. However, vmlinux file is quite large
    these days, reaching over 500MB. As a result, this degradates start-up
    time of crash command 10 or more seconds. (Of course, this depends on
    machines you use for investigation, but I guess typically we cannot
    use such powerful machines to investigate crash dump...)
    
    To resolve this issue, let's use bfd library and read linux_banner
    string in vmlinux file directly.
    
    A simple benchmark shows the following result:
    
    Without the fix:
    
        # cat ./commands.txt
        quit
        # time ./crash -i ./commands.txt \
            /usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/5.16.15-201.fc35.x86_64/vmlinux \

    arm64: fix the seek error of "pud page" for live debugging
    
    Crash reported an error on kernel v5.7 when live debugging with the
    command "crash vmlinux /proc/kcore":
    
      "crash: seek error: kernel virtual address: ffff75e9fffff000  type: "pud page""
    
    The reason is that the PTOV() and arm64_vtop_4level_4k() do not work
    as expected due to incorrect physvirt_offset.
    
    To fix the above issue, need to read out the virtual address of
    "physvirt_offset" from the "/proc/kallsyms", and update the
    ms->phys_offset which is initialized with a wrong value in kernel
    version [5.4, 5.10).

    arm64: fix the wrong vmemmap_end
    
    The VMEMMAP_END did not exist before the kernel v5.7, but for now, the
    value of vmemmap_end may be set to -1(0xffffffffffffffffUL).
    
    According to the arch/arm64/mm/dump.c (before kernel v5.7):
        ..................................................
          { VMEMMAP_START + VMEMMAP_SIZE, "vmemmap end" }
        ..................................................
    
    The vmemmap_end should always be:
    vmemmap_end = vmemmap_vaddr + vmemmap_size;
    
    This patch fixes the above issue.

    arm64: deduce the start address of kernel code, based on kernel version
    
    After kernel commit e2a073dde921 ("arm64: omit [_text, _stext) from
    permanent kernel mapping"), the range [_text, _stext] is reclaimed. But
    the current crash code still assumes kernel starting from "_text".
    
    This change only affects the vmalloced area on arm64 and may result a
    false in arm64_IS_VMALLOC_ADDR().
    
    Since vmcore has no extra information about this trival change, it can
    only be deduced from kernel version, which means ms->kimage_text can not
    be correctly initialized until kernel_init() finishes. Here on arm64, it
    can be done at the point machdep_init(POST_GDB). This is fine
    since there is no access to vmalloced area at this stage.

    x86_64_init: Refresh vmalloc region addresses in POST_RELOC instead of POST_GDB phase
    
    Previously for x86_64, when memory is randomized, the region addresses
    such as vmalloc_start_addr/vmemmap_vaddr/modules_vaddr are firstly set
    to a default value before POST_RELOC phase, then get refreshed with the
    actual value in POST_GDB phase.
    
    However for crash mininal mode, POST_GDB phase is not called, which
    leaving the region addresses unrefreshed and incorrect. As a consequence,
    the x86_64_IS_VMALLOC_ADDR check will give a faulty result when
    value_search tries to search a symbol by address.
    
    For example, in crash minimal mode we can observe the following issue:
    
        crash> dis -f panic
        dis: cannot resolve address: ffffffffb20e0d30
    
        crash> sym panic
        ffffffffb20e0d30 (T) panic /usr/src/debug/kernel-4.18.0-290/linux-4.18.0-290/kernel/panic.c: 168
        crash> sym ffffffffb20e0d30
        symbol not found: ffffffffb20e0d30
    
    In this patch, we will move the code which update the region addresses into
    POST_RELOC phase, so in mininal mode the regions can get the correct
    addresses.

    log: introduce "log -s" option to display printk safe buffers
    
    Introduce a new "log -s" option, which outputs unflushed logs in the
    printk safe buffers (safe_print_seq and nmi_print_seq) as follows:
    
      crash> log -s
      PRINTK_SAFE_SEQ_BUF: nmi_print_seq
      CPU: 0  ADDR: ffff8ca4fbc19ce0 LEN: 150  MESSAGE_LOST: 0
        Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 20 on CPU 0.
        Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
        Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
      ...
    
    The buffers are displayed for each CPU.  For an empty buffer,
    '(empty)' will be printed.
    
    Also append those to the bottom of "log" command output so as not to
    overlook them like this:
    
      crash> log
      ...
      [nmi_print_seq] Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 30 on CPU 0.",
      [nmi_print_seq] Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?",
      [nmi_print_seq] Dazed and confused, but trying to continue",
    
    Note that the safe buffer (struct printk_safe_seq_buf) was introduced
    at kernel-4.11 (Merge commit 7d91de74436a69c2b78a7a72f1e7f97f8b4396fa)
    and removed at kernel-5.15 (93d102f094be9beab28e5afb656c188b16a3793b).

    Currently on arm64, NT_PRSTATUS notes in dumpfile are not mapped to

    result, the "bt" command can cause a segmentation fault.

    To fix this,
    1) make map_cpus_to_prstatus_kdump_cmprs() map the notes to
       dd->nt_prstatus_percpu also on arm64, and
    2) move arm64_get_crash_notes() to machdep_init(POST_INIT) in order

    Improve the ps performance for vmcores with large number of threads
    
    Previously, the ps command will iterate over all threads which
    have the same tgid, to accumulate their rss value, in order to
    get a thread/process's final rss value as part of the final output.
    
    For non-live systems, the rss accumulation values are identical for
    threads which have the same tgid, so there is no need to do the
    iteration and accumulation repeatly, thus a lot of readmem calls are
    skipped. Otherwise it will be the performance bottleneck if the
    vmcores have a large number of threads.
    
    In this patch, the rss accumulation value will be stored in a cache,
    next time a thread with the same tgid will take it directly without
    the iteration.
    
    For example, we can monitor the performance issue when a vmcore has
    ~65k processes, most of which are threads for several specific
    processes. Without the patch, it will take ~7h for ps command
    to finish. With the patch, ps command will finish in 1min.

    Remove ptype command from "ps -t" option to reduce memory and time
    
    With some vmlinux e.g. RHEL9 ones, the first execution of the gdb ptype
    command heavily consumes memory and time.  The "ps -t" option uses it in
    start_time_timespec(), and it can be replaced with the crash macros.
    
    This can reduce about 1.4 GB memory and 6 seconds time comsumption in
    the following test:
    
      $ echo "ps -t" | time crash vmlinux vmcore
    
      Without the patch:

    Although the ptype command and similar ones cannot be fully removed,
    but removing some of them will make the use of crash safer, especially

    Fix pvops Xen detection for arm machine
    
    Since the xen_start_info on the arm/arm64 platform points to a static
    variable '_xen_start_info'(see its definition as below), which makes
    that the address of xen_start_info will never be null.
    
    arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c:40:static struct start_info _xen_start_info;
    arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c:41:struct start_info *xen_start_info = &_xen_start_info;
    arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c:42:EXPORT_SYMBOL(xen_start_info);
    
    As a result, the is_pvops_xen() in commit 4badc6229c69 ("Fix pvops
    Xen detection for kernels >= v4.20") always returns TRUE because it
    can always read out the non-null address of xen_start_info, finally
    the following error will be reported on arm/arm64 platform(non-Xen
    environment) because p2m_mid_missing and xen_p2m_addr are not defined:
    
            crash: cannot resolve "p2m_top"
    
    For the arm/arm64 platform, fix it by using xen_vcpu_info instead of
    xen_start_info to detect Xen dumps.
    
    In addition, also explicitly narrow the scope of the xen_start_info
    check to x86 with the machine_type(), there is no need to check it on
    other architectures.

    defs.h: fix breakage of compatibility of struct symbol_table_data for extension modules
    
    Commit <3ab39203ddd9> ("symbols: Implement install and remove operations
    for mod_symname_hash") added new member variable mod_symname_hash in the
    middle of struct symbol_table_date, which breaks compatibility of struct
    symbol_table_data for extension modules. As the result, crash trace command
    results in segmentation fault.

    arm64: Support overflow stack panic
    
    Kernel commit <872d8327ce89> ("arm64: add VMAP_STACK overflow detection")
    has supported the overflow stack exception handling. Without the patch, the
    "bt" command will make crash generate a core dump because of segmentation
    fault. With the patch, the "bt" command can display the overflow stack.
    
    Before:
    crash> bt
    PID: 3607   TASK: ffffffcbf9a4da00  CPU: 2   COMMAND: "sh"
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)
