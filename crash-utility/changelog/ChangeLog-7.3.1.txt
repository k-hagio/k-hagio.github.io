    log: add warning to help text to inform the inaccuracy of -T option
    
    The timestamps of the "log -T" option are inaccurate because they are
    from local_clock(), which returns the raw counter in the local CPU and
    it's different from the elapsed wall time.
    
    The dmesg command, which the "log -T" option imitates, has a similar
    behavior in nature and a warning in its help text.  Let's add a warning
    also to the crash's help text to inform the inaccuracy for now.

    Fix live debugging with lockdown=integrity
    
    With kernel lockdown the access to kernel interfaces that allow to
    extract confidential information (lockdown=confidentiality) or modify a
    running kernel (lockdown=integrity) can be restricted. Two of the
    interfaces that can be restricted are /dev/mem (integrity &
    confidentiality) and /proc/kcore (confidentiality). With
    lockdown=integrity this leads to a situation where /dev/mem exists but
    is not readable while /proc/kcore exists and is readable. This breaks
    crash's live debugging when it is invoked without argument, i.e.
    
    $ crash
    [...]
    crash: /dev/mem: Operation not permitted
    
    while passing /proc/kcore as image succeeds. The reason for this is that
    crash always picks /dev/mem as source when it exits but doesn't check if
    it is readable. Fix this by only selecting /dev/mem when it is readable.

    arm64: Use VA_BITS for page_offset calculation
    
    Commit 167d37e347fe ("arm64: assign page_offset with VA_BITS kernel
    configuration value") changed the page_offset calculation from
    using VA_BITS_ACTUAL to CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS.  This caused an error
    for ramdumps without vmcoreinfo like this:
    
      crash: vmlinux and /var/tmp/ramdump_elf_XUtCMT do not match!
    
    Set the vmcoreinfo value to VA_BITS if available, and use VA_BITS
    for page_offset calculation instead.
    
    Also remove ARM64_FLIP_PAGE_OFFSET_ACTUAL because it's not used
    actually.

    symbols: Implement install and remove operations for mod_symname_hash
    
    Currently the sequence for symbol_search to search a symbol is: 1) kernel
    symname hash table, 2) iterate all kernel symbols, 3) iterate all kernel
    modules and their symbols. In the worst case, if a non-exist symbol been
    searched, all 3 stages will be went through. The time consuming status for
    each stage is like:
    
        stage 1         stage 2         stage 3
        0.007000(ms)    0.593000(ms)    2.421000(ms)
    
    stage 3 takes too much time when comparing to stage 1. This patch series
    introduces a symname hash table for kernel modules, to improve the
    performance of symbol searching.
    
    Functions symbol_search() and symbol_exists() are fundamental and widely
    used by other crash functions, thus the benefit of performance improvement
    can get accumulated. For example, "ps -m" and "irq" commands, which call
    the functions many times, will become faster with the patch series.
    
    This patch indroduces mod_symname_hash, and its install/remove operations.
    Since symbol_search() has to return the lowest address symbol and
    symbol_search_next() returns the next lowest symbol, thus the installation
    should be sorted ascendingly.
    
    In mod_symname_hash_install_range() scenario, spn are already arranged
    ascendingly, so for mod_symname_hash_install():
    
    Install spn previous to sp:
    
      If sp is the start of bucket, or
      1) spn->value is smaller than sp->value.
    
    Install spn next to sp:
    
      1) sp->name_hash_next is NULL, or
      2) sp->name_hash_next->value is larger than spn->value
    
    spn->value is the kernel address of the symbol and will not change.
    So we use it mainly to determine the sequence. When spn->value equals
    sp->value, they must be symbols within a kernel module.

    diskdump: Print total number of dumpable pages
    
    It's not clear how broken an incomplete dump from the existing debugging
    prints. Aggregate number of valid pages helps to figure out approximate
    size of the dump. Size of a complete dump is roughly:
    
      EXPECTED_CORE_SIZE = a few pages (kdump headers + bitmaps + descriptors) +
                           (total_valid_pages * block_size) * compression rate
    
    An incomplete core would be significantly smaller than:

    diskdump: Fail readmem() early if dump is incomplete
    
    kdump format description [1] says:
    
       [...] zero page has its own offset not equal 0. So when reading page
       from incomplete core, only the page lost by ENOSPACE errors has 0 in its
       corresponding page descriptor's member offset.
    
    crash has special treatment for page descriptors with zero offset only if
    DUMP_DH_COMPRESSED_INCOMPLETE is set in dump header. However,
    makedumpfile places the flag after ENOSPC is hit and only if dump header
    modification went without errors.
    
    In case if crashkernel environment was terminated early (e.g. by BMC) or
    some other reason, DUMP_DH_COMPRESSED_INCOMPLETE won't be set on the
    dump header. Then cache_page() would be performed on pages with
    pd.offset == 0 and due to pd.size == 0 it'll skip read into
    compressed_page and then non related pre-existing contents of
    compressed_page will copied into page cache for the non-present page.
    
    Ultimately, it'll lead to a cryptic failure, like:
    
      crash: invalid kernel virtual address: 72288cacacf427f8 [...]
    
    The failure would be a bit cleaner if crash explicitly fails on the page
    that is an outcome of incomplete dump:
    
      crash: page incomplete: kernel virtual address: c000003fff9d17e8 [...]
    
    Debugging level 8 would also produce exact offset from data_offset to
    print descriptor value with ease:
    
      read_diskdump/cache_page: descriptor with zero offset found at paddr/pfn/pos: 3fff9d0000/3fff9d/743dd
    
    That helps in inspecting broken descriptor with hexdump or similar tools:
    
      hexdump -s (data_offset + pos * 0x18) -n 0x18

    arm64: implement switchable PTOV()/VTOP() for kernels >= 5.10
    
    Crash encounters a bug like the following:
        ...
        SECTION_SIZE_BITS: 30
        CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS: 52
              VA_BITS_ACTUAL: 48

        crash: read error: kernel virtual address: ffff000b779c0050  type: "IRQ stack pointer"
        ...
    
    Apparently, for a normal system, the 'paddr: fff1000bf79c0050' is
    unreasonable.
    
    This bug connects with kernel commit 7bc1a0f9e176 ("arm64: mm: use
    single quantity to represent the PA to VA translation"), which removed
    physvirt_offset kernel variable and changed the PTOV()/VTOP() formulas.
    
    Implement switchable PTOV()/VTOP() to cope with different kernel
    version.

    arm64: use dedicated bits to record the VA space layout changes
    
    arm64 memory layout experiences big changes due to the following kernel
    commits in date descending order:
      5. 7bc1a0f9e176 arm64: mm: use single quantity to represent the PA to VA translation
      4. b6d00d47e81a arm64: mm: Introduce 52-bit Kernel VAs
      3. 5383cc6efed1 arm64: mm: Introduce vabits_actual
      2. 14c127c957c1 arm64: mm: Flip kernel VA space
      1. f80fb3a3d508 arm64: add support for kernel ASLR
    
    For 1, crash has already used NEW_VMEMMAP to trace it.
    For 2, crash lacks a flag to tag it and handle it differently.
    For 3, two important kernel variables vabits_actual and physvirt_offset
    are introduced.
    For 4, since it comes immediately after 3, crash-utility does not need
    to distinguish it.
    For 5, kernel variable phyvirt_offset is removed
    
    These changes have effects on PTOV()/VTOP() formula. So introducing
    two bits HAS_PHYSVIRT_OFFSET and FLIPPED_VM as hint to apply different
    formula.

    arm64: assign page_offset with VA_BITS kernel configuration value
    
    On RHEL9, crash hits a bug when executing "crash /proc/kcore":
    seek error: kernel virtual address: ffff6a0f3fff0000 type: "pmd page"
    
    The kernel virtual address does not vary with vabits_actual, instead,
    is determined by configuration value. But crash does not observe this
    fact.
    
    Since vabits_actual related kernel commit is introduced after arm64
    mm layout flip commit, so changes are safe under the condition if
    (ms->VA_BITS_ACTUAL), and keep the else branch untouched.

    Fix pvops Xen detection for kernels >= v4.20
    
    Kernel commit 5c83511bdb9832c86be20fb86b783356e2f58062 removed
    pv_init_ops, and later commit 054ac8ad5ebe4a69e1f0e842483821ddbe560121
    removed the Xen-specific paravirt patch function. As a result, pvops Xen
    dumps are no longer recognized as Xen dumps, and virtual-to-physical
    translation fails.
    
    Use the value of xen_start_info to determine whether the kernel is
    running in Xen PV mode. This pointer is set during the initialization of
    a PV domain. Kudos to Juergen Gross, who suggested this check.

    Three fixes for MIPS64 kernels:
     (1) To support ramdumps, add the machine_type() check for MIPS64 in
         ramdump_to_elf().
     (2) To fix a stuck issue when invoking crash with "-d1" or larger
         debug value, add the machine_type() check to get the correct
         dump NOTE offsets.
     (3) Fix the reference file path to the definition of the pt_regs
         structure, to which mips64_regster refers.
