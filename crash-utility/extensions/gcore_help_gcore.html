NAME
  gcore - gcore - retrieve a process image as a core dump

SYNOPSIS
  gcore 
  gcore [-v vlevel] [-f filter] [pid | taskp]*
  This command retrieves a process image as a core dump.

DESCRIPTION
  
    -v Display verbose information according to vlevel:
  
           progress  library error  page fault

         7    x             x             x
  
    -f Specify kinds of memory to be written into core dumps according to
       the filter flag in bitwise:
  
           AP  AS  FP  FS  ELF HP  HS  DD

    -V Display version information
  
  If no pid or taskp is specified, gcore tries to retrieve the process image
  of the current task context.
  
  The file name of a generated core dump is core.&lt;pid> where pid is PID of
  the specified process.
  
  For a multi-thread process, gcore generates a core dump containing
  information for all threads, which is similar to a behaviour of the ELF
  core dumper in Linux kernel.
  
  Notice the difference of PID on between crash and linux that ps command in
  crash utility displays LWP, while ps command in Linux thread group tid,
  precisely PID of the thread group leader.
  
  gcore provides core dump filtering facility to allow users to select what
  kinds of memory maps to be included in the resulting core dump. There are
  7 kinds memory maps in total, and you can set it up with set command.
  For more detailed information, please see a help command message.
  
EXAMPLES
  Specify the process you want to retrieve as a core dump. Here assume the
  process with PID 12345.
  
    crash> gcore 12345
    Saved core.12345
    crash>
  
  Next, specify by TASK. Here assume the process placing at the address
  f9d7000 with PID 32323.
  
    crash> gcore f9d78000
    Saved core.32323
    crash>
  
  If multiple arguments are given, gcore performs dumping process in the
  order the arguments are given.
  
    crash> gcore 5217 ffff880136d72040 23299 24459 ffff880136420040
    Saved core.5217
    Saved core.1130
    Saved core.1130
    Saved core.24459
    Saved core.30102
    crash>
  
  If no argument is given, gcore tries to retrieve the process of the current
  task context.
  
    crash> set
         PID: 54321
     COMMAND: "bash"
        TASK: e0000040f80c0000
         CPU: 0
       STATE: TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
    crash> gcore
    Saved core.54321
  
  When a multi-thread process is specified, the generated core file name has
  the thread leader's PID; here it is assumed to be 12340.
  
    crash> gcore 12345
    Saved core.12340
  
  It is not allowed to specify two same options at the same time.
  
    crash> gcore -v 1 1234 -v 1
    Usage: gcore
      gcore [-v vlevel] [-f filter] [pid | taskp]*
      gcore -d
    Enter "help gcore" for details.
  
  It is allowed to specify -v and -f options in a different order.
  
    crash> gcore -v 2 5201 -f 21 ffff880126ff9520 5205
    Saved core.5174
    Saved core.5217
    Saved core.5167
    crash> gcore 5201 ffff880126ff9520 -f 21 5205 -v 2
    Saved core.5174
    Saved core.5217
    Saved core.5167
