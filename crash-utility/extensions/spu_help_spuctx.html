NAME
  spuctx - shows complete info about a SPU context

SYNOPSIS
  spuctx [ID | PID | CTXADDR] ...

DESCRIPTION
  This command shows the fields of spu and spu_context structs for a 
SPU context, including debug info specially saved by kdump after a 
crash.
  By default, it shows info about all the contexts created by the 
system, including ones in the runqueue. To specify the contexts of 
interest, the PID of the controller task, ID of the SPU which the 
context is bound to or the address of spu_context struct can be used 
as parameters.

EXAMPLES

  Show info about contexts bound to SPUs 0 and 7, and the one 
controlled by thread whose PID is 1524:

    crash> spuctx 0 7 1524
